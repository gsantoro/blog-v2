## About me
👋 Hi there! Welcome to my Blog. I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Elastic (formerly Elasticsearch), immersing myself in an array of modern tech: 
- ☁️ Cloud Native 
- 🔍 Observability
- 📦 Kubernetes & Containers
- 🔄 DevOps
- 💻 Golang
- ☁️ AWS Cloud

Before Elastic, I put on a couple of interesting hats 💼. I was a Big Data Engineer at Playstation, transforming data into action 🎮. I also shared my knowledge as a Hadoop Trainer 🎓.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing squash 🎾, enjoying PlayStation games 🎮, or out on a hike 🏞️. I believe in constant learning and have acquired several certifications like the 🏅 Certified Kubernetes Administrator and 🎖️ multiple Hadoop certifications.

Feel free to explore my articles and connect on Twitter if you'd like to discuss anything tech. Thanks for visiting! 👍

I'm also mentoring Software Engineers and DevOps Engineers on [Mentorcruise](https://mentorcruise.com). Feel free to check my profile by clicking the link below.
